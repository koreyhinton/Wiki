## Knapsack Problem

Approximate solution runs in O(n<sup>2</sup> v<sub>max</sub>) <sup>[1]</sup>. So the time complexity depends on the number of items and the maximum value an item can be.

## Halting Problem
Given a program as input, can you determine whether the program will terminate or keep running forever? The halting problem is undecidable and it has been proven that a solution cannot exist<sup>[1]</sup>.
